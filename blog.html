                      One day, Heather was driving down the road listening to the radio when there was a down pour. She looked around the window trying to see a clear pathway to get home. She had her dog, Leon, in the car, and he was being no help. Finally, Heather and her dog had arrived home. They sprinted inside and were still drenched from the rain.  Heather goes to dry off Leon with a towel just as he decides he wanted to pull a Taylor Swift and “shake it off.” Water is going everywhere, causing more of a mess than before. Fur is flying through the air, the house smells like wet dog, and everything is chaos.

                    <p class="card-text">
                      A couple of days go by, and the odor has not been resolved. The odor reminded Heather that she needed to get her Air Ducts cleaned. So she calls Crystal Clean Duct Service for an Air Duct Cleaning in Manassas, VA.  She was very thankful that Crystal Clean was able to help her beyond her reach, and Leon’s reach.

                      You’ve heard the saying right? April showers bring May flowers? Well so far the month of May has been quite the wet and polluted season. People are sneezing and coughing so much that it’s hard to tell the difference between a head cold and allergies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Bradley lives in a smaller home with his wife, Janet, just off Centerville Road in Manassas, VA. He had his car in the shop and had to walk to work just five blocks away. When he was just about to get off his shift, he noticed the pouring down rain then realized he forgot his umbrella at home. So he walked home as his shift ended in the pouring rain. By the time he made it home, his clothes were dripping wet and causing him to shiver so much that that his sneezing was uncontrollable and he was unable to form a sentence. His wife took his clothes to put them in the dryer. 30 minutes later the dryer went off, and the clothes were still dripping wet. Not thinking about it, she turns on the dryer again for an additional 30 minutes. She continued this cycle repetitively four more times. Janet realized that something was wrong with her dryer. She called Crystal Clean Duct Service to come inspect it. Turns out, her heating element had a massive clog in it. Her face was petrified when Crystal Clean showed her how massive the clog was.

                    <p class="card-text">
                      So take a moment to think about the last time you were going somewhere and you had to dry your clothes briskly and they weren’t dry enough. Did you get mad at the dryer or wonder whether if something was wrong with your system? Then think again to second guess yourself?
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Don’t second guess yourself, ask another opinion today.

                      Are allergies getting the best of you this season? I know they were for Julia. We just helped our new customer, Julia, to make her air allergen free to help her breathe better. Julia lives in a suburban area in Ashburn, VA where most neighbors have gardens and pets. She has compared herself to Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer because of how the pollen is affecting her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Now that the sun is out and the temperature is picking up, the flowers are blooming; the pollen cause problems for not only you, but also the others around you.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      When you get home from day to day activities, you feel like you’re safe in your home, correct? Away from pollen because the plants are outside and you might not have animals to be allergic to. Well that’s where you are wrong. Inside your home there is an air duct where the pollen and pet hair gets sucked up and pile up in your vents preventing any fresh air to flow through your home. This means your allergy season could be longer than just a few days or weeks.  In the meantime, you are buying a copious amount of tissues and Claritin slowly turning yourself from Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer to Clifford the Big Red Dog.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Take a moment to think to yourself: Do you remember when the last time you had your air ducts cleaned out? Did you even know that you had air ducts that needed to be clean? Feel like your home air isn’t as clean as you thought now that you think about it?

                      Last week, an apartment customer called in need of an appointment for a dryer vent cleaning in Manassas, VA. This is a new customer who moved out on her own for the first time; she had never been away from mom and dad before now. In her apartment is a stackable washer and dryer.  She figured she didn’t have to pull the lint out of the vent, she could vacuum the lint up herself. Realizing that the dryer is on the top part of the stackable machines, she lifted the vacuum to try to get closer to the vent. Imagine, cleaning the dryer vent that should be helping your clothes get clean. Our new customer is holding a vacuum, that’s the same size as her, to clean off the lint in the back of the dryer. After all of that stress on her muscles trying to keep everything balanced, she ended up injuring herself. She realized that despite moving into the city on her own, she didn’t have to do all the cleaning alone. That’s where we came in.  After she explained the story in making the appointment, we started getting everything scheduled, then made our way to her apartment.
